Acemoglu,Daron,Uncertain,4,"Non-compete clauses excessively empower firms and are not justified by the arguments their proponents offer. Nevertheless, there is no convincing evidence yet that they have a big impact on wages.",Uncertain,4,Same as the previous question. The evidence is not there yet.,Disagree,4,There is no evidence that firms are investing in training because of non-competes.
Altonji,Joseph,Agree,6,,Uncertain,4,"Noncompetes help firms protect intellectual property, but they reduce the ability of new competitors to assemble a workforce.",Uncertain,3,
Auerbach,Alan,Uncertain,3,,Uncertain,3,,Agree,3,
Autor,David,Uncertain,6,"Noncompetes are abused by U.S. employers and pertain in sectors where trade secrets cannot possibly be relevant (e.g., sandwich makers at fast food restaurants). But we have no evidentiary basis for saying how large a wage or mobility impact this will have in the U.S. ",Uncertain,5,No info on this.,Uncertain,5,"Just don't have enough evidence to make any quantitative statement, even a qualitative quantitative statement(such as ""a measurable reduction"").

Deaton,Angus,Agree,5,,Agree,5,,Agree,4,
Duffie,Darrell,Agree,1,"Seems somewhat likely, but I don't have much conviction here, because this could radically change supply and demand in the related employment market in ways that I have difficulty predicting.",Agree,1,"Again, I don't have conviction. For example, maybe I am wrong because a ban  could make hiring the affected experts become uneconomic. ",Uncertain,1,
Edlin,Aaron,Agree,4,The FTC has put together some evidence on this point.  ,Agree,3,California provides some limited evidence. ,Agree,4,Theory suggests some effect.

Goldberg,Pinelopi,Disagree,6,Non-competes are typically valid for one year. It is unlikely that a one-year restriction would have substantial effects.,Disagree,5,See previous answer,Disagree,5,See previous answer

Hall,Robert,Uncertain,1,,Disagree,2,Protection of IP may be important for innovation,Agree,1,
Hart,Oliver,Uncertain,5,"Ex post, more competition for labor will increase the wage. But initial wages may be be lower because firms don't have to offer so much given that workers can move later.",Uncertain,5,Ideas will move more easily but firms will have less incentive to innovate given that their intellectual property rights are less secure.,Agree,6,"With respect to training in general skills, yes. With respect to training in specific skills, less clear."

Hoynes,Hilary,Uncertain,8,The key word is substantial. I think it will increase wages not not sure if substantial. ,Uncertain,5,I don’t know of research on this. ,Disagree,8,
Judd,Kenneth,Uncertain,6,,Agree,6,Non-compete clauses may protect employers' intellectual property but my guess is that they are overly broad and firms' deep pockets deter legal action against inefficient restrictions on employee movement. The net effect of limiting no-complete clauses would be positive.,Uncertain,6,
Kaplan,Steven,Disagree,5,Unlikely to be a large effect.,Disagree,3,,Uncertain,8,Depends on the industry.
Kashyap,Anil,Uncertain,3,"The sign is right, but magnitude is unclear to me.  Given that California already does not enforce them seems like there should a literature on this, hope other panelists can point to the best papers on this.

Levin,Jonathan,Agree,3,,Agree,3,,Disagree,3,
Maskin,Eric,Uncertain,5,"The direct effect should be an increase in wages because of the increase in competition. However, conceivably, there could be a general equilibrium effect that makes the entire industry less profitable---and thereby lowers workers' marginal products",Uncertain,5,"An increase in innovation is one possibility, since ideas would be spread more widely. But a decrease is also possible, since inventors would have a harder time getting a return on their investment",Agree,6,A firm is less likely to invest in an employee's human capital if that employee can turn around and work for the employee's competitor
