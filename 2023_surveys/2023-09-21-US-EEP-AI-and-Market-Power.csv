Acemoglu,Daron,Agree,6,"Microsoft-OpenAI and Google are heading towards leadership in (generative) AI, which could lead to an even more oligopolistic market. More structurally, the current approach AI relies on abundant  data as inputs and the rush to collect and use data will further weaken competition",Uncertain,5,"Possible, especially with open source and the construction of mid-size, targeted AI models and AI stacks. But there is no evidence that these are going to be effective competition against large foundation models. Moreover, incumbents will continue to use M&A to thwart competitors",Agree,5,"On balance, this would be my assessment, but there is a lot of uncertainty."

Autor,David,Uncertain,5,,Agree,5,"It offers opportunities. But they may be thwarted by incumbents, e.g., the way Facebook bought up potential rivals. This in part depends on antitrust enforcement, which in turns depends on who is President",Agree,6,"At least for the foundation models, scale appears extremely important. Many AI services will run on top of these models, but those services will likely be provided by many smaller firms, though within verticals, competition may not be robust"

Kaplan,Steven,Uncertain,8,I am confidently uncertain.,Uncertain,6,Uncertain because it is possible for  incumbents and / or new entrants to have some success.,Disagree,8,The technology is statistics / algorithms.  A key differentiating resource will be information.  Different players will have different information advantages.
Kashyap,Anil,Uncertain,1,"I can see arguments on both sides, maybe it leads to more disruption?",Agree,1,of course they may opt to sell to dominant incumbents too. ,Agree,1,"seems likely, but could they be different players than the currently dominant ones? "

Samuelson,Larry,Agree,4,"Tech markets have tended to be highly concentrated, so one might expect AI to exacerbate this trend, but the effect of AI is general very difficult to predict.",Agree,4,"To reconcile this with the previous answer, AI may well open many opportunities for entrants, but existing Tech giants have been good at preserving concentration by buying such entrants.",Agree,4,"Again much uncertainty, but high-tech tends to exhibit network externalities that lead to concentration; AI may continue this trend."

Schmalensee,Richard,Uncertain,7,Much to early to call.,Agree,4,"Seems probable, since it will enable the creation of new products. But if scale economies end up being very important, it may just entrench incumbents.",Disagree,5,"First, ""the AI industry"" makes no sense. There will ultimately be multiple markets. Second, it is too early to predict the structure of most, if not all, of these markets."
