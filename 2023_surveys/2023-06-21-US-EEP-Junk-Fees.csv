Acemoglu,Daron,Agree,3,,Uncertain,3,"It is uncertain whether most customers would search, process and act on this type of information, given busy schedules, other transaction costs and sometimes low financial literacy.",Uncertain,3,"I am not convinced that transparency would work by itself. Capping fees could backfire, especially if these caps are excessively tight. But on balance, regulation may be better for ticketing consumers than just transparency. Still there is much uncertainty."

Autor,David,Uncertain,6,"This definitely reduce credit card fees. I also suspect this would it be harder for people with relatively low credit scores to get credit cards. In the worst case, more people low-credit borrowers will be forced to use payday lenders, which will be much more expensive ",Uncertain,7,This won't hurt. But I don't think it will have a substantial effect. People have self-control problems and succumb to myopic behavior in borrowing and repayment. ,Uncertain,6,I'm not sure that people respond strongly to this type of information. But I favor trying it. There's no good-for-consumer reasons that this information is made obscure. And the fact that is often hidden suggests that lenders believe that revealing it would save consumers money.

Duffie,Darrell,Agree,6,,Disagree,9,"Most of the costs are borne through the effect of merchant fees, especially interchange fees. Consumers bear these indirectly through merchant prices. Consumers will tend to pay more attention to the rewards funded by merchant fees. More competition might backfire. See Wang, 2023",Disagree,4,"Consumers are not so attentive to banking markups. For example, they have trillions of dollars  of deposits on which the receive almost no interest."
