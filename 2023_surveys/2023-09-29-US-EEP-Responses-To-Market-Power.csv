Acemoglu,Daron,Disagree,6,"First, there is disagreement on what the scope of current tools are (e.g., can we use them to break up the gargantuan big tech?). Second, the high speed and uncontrolled rollout of (generative) AI necessitates new regulatory tools. These should target more than just competition.",Agree,6,"The US has lost the ""regulatory muscle"" for dealing with large firms in any sector. But worse, the gov. lacks expertise and is also ideologically captured by big tech (witness how lawmakers & administration turn to tech CEOs whenever there is a question of regulation).",Strongly Agree,6,"Current favorite US tools, antitrust and lawsuits, are ex post, weak and insufficient. The age of AI necessitates ex ante regulations that prevent dangerous rollout of technologies and guarantees on safety before mass launch, and tools for redirecting AI innovation and use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
