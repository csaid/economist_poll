Acemoglu,Daron,Uncertain,3,"We should always be careful in blocking new technologies, hence my answer is ""uncertain"". But it is not clear what major (positive) innovation spillovers from TikTok are, and social media will have to be regulated. Regulations that also apply to US platforms would be better.",Agree,5,"Yes, unless they are also regulated and this is one reason why regulations that apply to all social media companies are better than just blocking TikTok."

But US innovation is a broad category to measurably impact. ",Agree,4,It would eliminate a big competitor in social media
Maskin,Eric,Uncertain,3,I don't know how much TikTok currently contributes to innovation.,Agree,4,TikTok seems to be taking quite a bit of business away from U.S. social media. A ban would give the American companies a chance to catch up.
