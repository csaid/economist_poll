Last Name,First Name,"Subsidizing Green Technology

 
Government subsidies for investment in green technologies are justified by substantial benefits coming from reducing unpriced carbon emissions and generating positive R&D spillovers.",Confidence in this topic (10 being the highest).,Please explain your response in 280 characters or less.,Using subsidies for green technologies instead of full carbon prices will lead to substantially more rent-seeking and hence substantially higher costs to achieve a given reduction in emissions.,Confidence in this topic (10 being the highest).,Please explain your response in 280 characters or less.
Acemoglu,Daron,Strongly Agree,8,"This is true even when there are carbon prices. The view that policy should set the right carbon price and the market can do the rest is invalid. R&D generates uninternalized spillovers, so there is a first-order need to redirect innovation even when there are carbon prices.",Disagree,6,There is no evidence that subsidies to green innovation lead to more wastage than any other type of innovation subsidies or R&D tax credits (which are ubiquitous throughout the industrialized world).
Altonji,Joseph,Strongly Agree,7,,Agree,7,"Full carbon pricing is a tough, tough sell. There is  scope for subsidizing R&D and initial investments in green technology even with carbon pricing  "
Auerbach,Alan,Agree,5,,Strongly Agree,7,
Autor,David,Strongly Agree,8,,Disagree,6,The question presumes these are substitutes and I disagree. Even full carbon pricing is not sufficient to create the efficient level of directed technical change. We require both carbon pricing _and_ subsidies. 
Banerjee,Abhijit,Agree,5,,Uncertain,3,The right carbon tax may be an unrealistic counterfactual. Governments seem to find it politically challenging to implement them.

Duffie,Darrell,Disagree,3,"Compared to the direct application of carbon taxes or permit markets, subsidizing green tech (although perhaps better than nothing) probably has a big negative value. It will be costly to monitor for efficacy and waste. If there are good spillovers, where is the market failure?",Strongly Agree,3,

Hart,Oliver,Agree,7,I would prefer carbon taxes but these seem politically challenging.,Agree,8,I'm not sure about the rent-seeking but the costs will be higher.
Holmström,Bengt,Strongly Agree,6,,Disagree,6,We should use full range of instruments. Both subsidies for investment and of course carbon prices.
Hoxby,Caroline,Uncertain,7,,Strongly Agree,10,
Hoynes,Hilary,Agree,8,,Agree,5,
Judd,Kenneth,Disagree,7,"Some subsidies may be justified but not large ones. ""Green tech"" should include any tech that reduces CO2 emissions, not just the popular ones. ",Agree,8,Carbon taxes go after the real problem efficiently. They raise revenues instead of increasing debt. Green subsidies are difficult to efficiently implement.

Nordhaus,William,Agree,8,This is theoretical. The calculations of the appropriate subsidy are difficult and almost never made.,Strongly Agree,9,The first theorem of public finance is tax bad don't subsidize disparate goods.

Samuelson,Larry,Agree,8,"Externalities and a lack of prices justify intervention, though other tools would be more effective than subsidies.",Agree,6,
Scheinkman,José,Agree,8,,Agree,6,"However, while one of the major political parties spouses ""flat-earth"" theories on climate change, there is no hope of passing carbon pricing."
Schmalensee,Richard,Agree,5,Only because carbon emissions are unpriced.,Strongly Agree,8,"Rent-seeking is not the major problem. Alternative ways of reducing carbon emissions are not treated equally, so costs would be substantially higher than necessary even without rent-seeking."
Shapiro,Carl,Strongly Agree,10,,Agree,8,
Shimer,Robert,Agree,2,,Strongly Agree,8,
Stock,James,Strongly Agree,9,"In theory, yes if the benefit exceeds the cost. For the subsidies to wind, solar and EVs in the IRA, the cost per ton is well less than the EPA’s estimate of the Social Cost of Carbon. Other subsidies can be less cost effective, for example some energy efficiency subsidies.",Disagree,7,"Disagree b/c rent seeking is only one channel and not the most important. Multiple externalities so efficiency of subsidies depends on case. R&D subsidies can be efficient for green innovation, but subsidies for deploying wind & solar are less efficient than carbon tax. "
Thaler,Richard,No Opinion,,Impossible to answer as posed. A subsidy *can* be just a negative tax or also a distortion.  Not a well-posed question.  ,No Opinion,,Ditto
Udry,Christopher,Strongly Agree,7,Subsidies for technological innovation are part of the solution,Agree,8,"Full pricing of emissions is much more important than subsidizing new tech, but both are called for. Subsidies can address externalities from learning and networks"
