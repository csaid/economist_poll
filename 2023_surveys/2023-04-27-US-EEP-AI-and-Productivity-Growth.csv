Acemoglu,Daron,Uncertain,6,"Though breakthroughs in large language models are impressive and appear to be capable of increasing human productivity, there is no evidence that they can be effectively employed in production. Past applications have often disappointed. Current direction of AI is also distorted. ",Agree,6,"There is some uncertainty here as well. But in its current direction AI is an ""inappropriate technology"" for many emerging economies and may slow down their growth, as it seeks to substitutes capital and programming skills for middle and low skills."

Auerbach,Alan,Uncertain,3,,Uncertain,3,
Autor,David,Uncertain,6,"It may accelerate scientific breakthroughs, but it may also spur social chaos. Whether the productive outpaces the destructive is uncertain. ",Agree,4,"AI is potentially an even bigger deal than the Internet for industrialized countries (though not for the developing world). Whether this potential will generate faster growth rates is, in my mind, uncertain given the vast potential for ancillary harms. "

Judd,Kenneth,Agree,6,"AI should improve economic growth but adoption of new tech will be slow because people do not like change, loss of status, etc.",Agree,7,"AI will directly improve measured growth because it will economize on use of inputs. Impact of internet (e.g. Facebook, Google) is less clear and more difficult to measure."
