Acemoglu,Daron,Uncertain,5,Three major uncertainties. 1. Not clear whether AI will successfully target tasks performed by the highly skilled. Evidence so far shows not. 2. Generative AI can also complement some high skill tasks. 3. Skilled workers can change occupations and shift negative effects to others,Disagree,5,"Though there is some uncertainty the burden will fall on less educated workers. Social skills will become valuable, and specialized technical skills as well as higher education will most likely remain protected from AI. The flexibility conferred by education will also be valuable",Agree,5,"While it is possible for generative AI to be a useful tool for noncollege workers, I do not see the current path achieving this, and the existing evidence is more consistent with most of the burden of displacement falling on less educated, lower-wage workers."

Autor,David,Agree,6,"I think this will be a _relative_ effect not an absolute effect. I don't think that AI will make us poorer, and it may not (or it may) reduce the labor share. But I suspect (hope) that it may contribute to reduced inequality",Agree,6,Perhaps four-year college degrees won't appear so damn relevant to every well-paid occupation in industrialized economies. That would be a good thing. ,Disagree,6,I think it's slightly more likely to do the opposite. 
Banerjee,Abhijit,Disagree,5,The highest skilled workers will benefit from it. The medium skilled ones will be displaced,Agree,5,,Agree,5,

Nordhaus,William,Agree,5,"Like all major new technologies, it will be disruptive. It may be more rapid than earlier changes given the speed of diffusion in the electronic age. But whether it will be a large fraction or relative minor, not clear.",Disagree,5,"Do not see it as reducing the returns to education, but is likely to be highly disruptive in that sector. Probabiy increases the uncertainty about the structure of education, but then so did Google for libraries.",Disagree,5,I think the impact on aggregate economic factors for the next decade is exaggerated.
