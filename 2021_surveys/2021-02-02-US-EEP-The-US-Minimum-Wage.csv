Last Name,First Name,"The current US federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. States can choose whether to have a higher minimum - and many do.
A federal minimum wage of $15 per hour would lower employment for low-wage workers in many states.",Confidence in this topic (10 being the highest).,Please explain your response in 140 characters or less.,A federal minimum wage that is pegged to state and/or local conditions such as the cost of living would be preferable to the current arrangements that give states a role in setting the policy.,Confidence in this topic (10 being the highest).,Please explain your response in 140 characters or less.
Acemoglu,Daron,Uncertain,5,Evidence is that small increases in min. wage (starting from US lows) don't have large disemployment effects. Don't know what $15 will do,Agree,4,$15 min wage would have very different effects in MA than in AL. But a cost of living adjustment should be legislated at the federal level
Altonji,Joseph,Agree,8,,Agree,6,
Auerbach,Alan,Agree,5,,Uncertain,3,
Autor,David,Disagree,5,The weight of the evidence does not support large job loss. But I'm above extra nervous about setting min $15/hr during the pandemic. ,Agree,7,"Although states can & do calibrate upward, the federal min is valuable. Approx 20 states simply adhere to federal lower bound. "
Baicker,Katherine,Agree,3,,Uncertain,3,
Banerjee,Abhijit,No Opinion,,The question seems incomplete. Suppose wages double and employment goes down by 1%. Is that a yes or a no? Also over what time horizon? ,Agree,5,

Chetty,Raj,Did Not Answer,,,Did Not Answer,,
Chevalier,Judith,Uncertain,8,"The question says ""lower employment"" rather than ""substantially lower"". No extant study allows us to rule out some employment effects.",Uncertain,8,So much depends on precise design.
Cutler,David,Agree,4,"""Many"" is a tough word. Perhaps many states but for many fewer people.",Agree,5,Minimum likely better than a maximum

Finkelstein,Amy,Uncertain,5,,Uncertain,5,
Goldberg,Pinelopi,Uncertain,5,Research has shown modest min. wage increases do not increase unemployment. But going from $6 to $15 in the current situation is not modest.,Agree,5,"Otherwise we end up with a race to the bottom. But should be paired with federal standards on safety, working conditions, etc."
Goolsbee,Austan,Disagree,5,,Agree,5,
Greenstone,Michael,Uncertain,6,uncertain esp about 'many states' bc it is an out of sample increase relative to existing studies & sector under duress with covid fallout,Uncertain,4,design details would matter a lot. quite some appeal to a federal floor that is a function of state/local conditions & pegged to inflation
Hall,Robert,Agree,7,,Uncertain,2,"Hard to guess who would do more harm, feds or states."

Holmström,Bengt,Agree,7,,Agree,4,
Hoxby,Caroline,Agree,10,,Uncertain,10,"If there is a federal minimum, should be pegged to local conditions like cost-of-living. Seems no logic to forbidding state & local role... "
Hoynes,Hilary,Uncertain,8,"Not well worded - I would say DISAGREE if it were ""would not reduce employment substantially"".",Agree,8,
Judd,Kenneth,Agree,7,,Agree,6,"The definition of ""local"" is critical. State-level averages ignore important variations. MSA and county level averages would be better.
"
Kaplan,Steven,Strongly Agree,8,$15 per hour is a high wage in a number of states.  Marginal product is less than $15 per hour for many.,Disagree,8,"Would be inclined to let states decide.  If they decide well, labor and employers will come.  If they decide badly, the states will decline."
Kashyap,Anil,Agree,5,,Uncertain,3,it depends on how much variance would be built in and how the average level were set.  
Klenow,Pete,Agree,4,"I think so, but variable effort could mitigate the negative effect.",Uncertain,1,
Levin,Jonathan,Uncertain,3,"Not sure state comparisons make sense - in CA, Bay Area impact might be minimal, and maybe not so in rural areas. ",Uncertain,4,"Indexing is appealing on the pure economics, but I would want to know more about the complexity and implementation. "
Maskin,Eric,Uncertain,4,"An increase to $15/hour is a big jump, and I'm not sure we have the data to know what the effect on employment would be.",Uncertain,4,"Not sure what the question is. Making the federal wage depend on local conditions sounds good, but why not let states top that if they want?"
Nordhaus,William,Did Not Answer,,,Did Not Answer,,
Obstfeld,Maurice,Uncertain,4,,Uncertain,4,The Fed minimum preferably should be indexed to local conditions. Does not imply (as the question seems to) that states can have no role.
Saez,Emmanuel,Disagree,8,,Agree,5,
Samuelson,Larry,Agree,6,"Evidence on employment effects of minimum wages is inconclusive, and the employment losses may well be small.  ",Agree,8,Tailoring the minimum wage to local conditions would help ameliorate employment effects.
Scheinkman,José,Uncertain,5,,Disagree,6,A federal minimum wage  pegged to state conditions should serve as a floor to a state's minimum wage.
Schmalensee,Richard,Agree,4,"Such a big change would surely have some effect -- not clear it would be large, though.",Strongly Agree,5,"""Preferable"" reflects my preferences, of course, & my belief that in some states the government is hostile to low income workers of color. "
Shapiro,Carl,Agree,3,"Demand for labor is presumably downward sloping, but the question does not ask anything about magnitudes.  ",Agree,6,A State can set a higher minimum than the federal minimum rate for that State.
Shimer,Robert,Strongly Agree,8,$15 is above the current median hourly wage in several states and close to it in many more. This will dramatically change those economies,Disagree,5,There is value to allowing localities to tailor policies to local preferences. It is hard to see the value of national coordination here
Stock,James,Agree,5,,Agree,7,
Thaler,Richard,Disagree,5,The literature suggests minimal effects on employment. ,Uncertain,1,Hard to say without knowing the details. It is hard to write legislation that is fine-tuned. 
Udry,Christopher,Disagree,5,"Perhaps in some of the lowest-wage states, but the evidence is that for most states there would be little effect on employment.",Agree,4,I'm not very confident about how the politics would work.
