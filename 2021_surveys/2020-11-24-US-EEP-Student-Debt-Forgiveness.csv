Acemoglu,Daron,Uncertain,3,Would depend on how it's done. Yes lots of student debt among those earning more than 100K a year. So risk of handout to yuppies is there.,Agree,4,"Yes this would be much better. Student debt is a problem for low and middle income households, not those earning more than 100K or 150K.",Agree,4,"Unemployment benefits, aid to states and general stimulus would be more effective in the current pandemic environment."

Autor,David,Strongly Agree,10,"Alongside my kids' student loans, I'd like the government to pay off my mortgage. If the latter idea shocks you, the first one should too",Agree,6,"This could create terrible incentives, both for labor supply and (bad) educational investments. Proceed with great caution",Disagree,6,General income-based transfer payments could always be used to pay student loans. That's the beauty of cash over in-kind transfers

Edlin,Aaron,Agree,7,College graduates earn more than nongraduates though presumably those who pay off loans or didn’t borrow and wouldn’t benefit earn even more,Agree,7,It would depend on the threshold. ,Disagree,7,Targeting aid to those who need it is most humane.
