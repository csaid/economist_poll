Acemoglu,Daron,Uncertain,5,"With better lockdown policies, there would have been tens of thousands of fewer deaths, but probably not much better GDP outcomes.",Agree,2,"The key word is SAFELY. That means COVID is under control. If schools open without that, second wave would be much worse and GDP would fall."
Altonji,Joseph,Agree,3,,Uncertain,3,
Auerbach,Alan,Agree,3,,Agree,7,
Autor,David,Agree,5,"Korea is the best case scenario. Germany had its act together. The U.S. response was chaotic, and this has slowed the eventual rebound",Agree,6,Boost will come *years later* when students reach the labor market with more skills. Status quo is a disaster for human capital formation!
Baicker,Katherine,Agree,3,,Agree,3,
Banerjee,Abhijit,Uncertain,5,Less people would have died--that is what we know for sure.,Uncertain,5,"I don't know why opening of schools would have a large causal effect, but may be it is a signal the economy can coordinate on."
Bertrand,Marianne,Uncertain,5,"more uniform: yes; longer: less clear vs, say, strict mandating of masks and social distancing.",Agree,7,
Brunnermeier,Markus,Uncertain,4,"The intervention should have been earlier, more targeted, and more thoughtful (complemented with more efficient testing and tracing). ",Uncertain,5,
Chetty,Raj,Agree,9,,Agree,9,
Chevalier,Judith,Uncertain,4,The economy would be stronger if the stay at home time was used productively to rapidly ramp up testing and other virus responses. ,Agree,7,Opening schools likely has a direct effect but also the question implies an environment in which the virus is under more control. 
Cutler,David,Strongly Agree,5,,Agree,5,
Deaton,Angus,Uncertain,7,"There are many many puzzling features of the dynamics of the pandemic, both here and around the world. So hard to know.",Strongly Agree,7,Especially women
Duffie,Darrell,Agree,2,"Yes, although we have since learned that very extensive use of masks, without a stay-at-home order, would have worked and been less costly.",Strongly Agree,2,"Parents could then resume more productive work. Also, this likely generates short-run and long-run benefits for children."
Edlin,Aaron,Agree,6,,Uncertain,8,Likely to depend on time frame.  If schools accelerate the virus spread a short-term boost might be more than offset later
Eichengreen,Barry,Uncertain,5,Widespread availability of testing enabling targeted stay-at-home orders together with contact tracing would have made for stronger economy,Agree,5,"""as soon as"" is different from ""because"". When schools are safe to open, other activities will also be safe, making for a substantial boost."
Einav,Liran,Agree,1,,Agree,1,
Fair,Ray,Uncertain,5,,Uncertain,5,"If causality is pandemic over, economy expands and schools open, it is the pandemic over, not the schools opening, that is the cause. "
Finkelstein,Amy,Uncertain,3,,Agree,6,
Goldberg,Pinelopi,Did Not Answer,,,Did Not Answer,,
Goolsbee,Austan,Uncertain,8,We needed to slow the spread of the virus (still do). Consistency would help as would but it isn't just about shelter-in-place ,Strongly Agree,10,You can't go to work if your kid has nowhere to go
Greenstone,Michael,Uncertain,2,"Unclear benefits of stay at home without without rigorous tracing, contact tracing, quarantining etc",Agree,5,I agree bc the question implies that we have a vaccine or herd immunity
Hall,Robert,Disagree,8,Research shows that almost all precautionary behavior would have occurred absent government orders,Agree,7,Ability to have universal K-12 in-person schooling would be a sign of advanced progress in all respects against the virus.

Hoxby,Caroline,Did Not Answer,,,Did Not Answer,,
Hoynes,Hilary,Agree,8,,Agree,8,
Judd,Kenneth,Agree,7,,Agree,6,
Kaplan,Steven,Disagree,6,More targeted lockdowns that encouraged more economic activity would have done better.,Strongly Agree,9,
Kashyap,Anil,Uncertain,5,"Natural caution was very important, hard to know if just stay at home would have been enough to control the virus spread. ",Agree,3,presumably other activities would also become safe then too
Klenow,Pete,Uncertain,5,Voluntary social distancing has been more uniform than lockdown policies.,Agree,4,"Partly causal, but more as an indicator."
Levin,Jonathan,Uncertain,3,,Agree,3,
Maskin,Eric,Agree,5,,Agree,5,
Nordhaus,William,Agree,6,Yes if uno]iform pol,Agree,5,‘Safely’ is big part of plan.

Saez,Emmanuel,Agree,4,,Agree,7,
Samuelson,Larry,Strongly Agree,8,"There are great returns to mitigating a potentially exponential process early, and doing so uniformly (to avoid weakest-link vulnerabilies.",Strongly Agree,8,Education has long-run returns as well as well as great short-run returns in facilitating labor force participation of others. 
Scheinkman,José,Did Not Answer,,,Did Not Answer,,
Schmalensee,Richard,Uncertain,7,Unknowable.  More businesses would have failed early on. Lots would depend on policies after the stay-at-home orders expired. ,Agree,7,"Emphasis on ""safely""."
Shapiro,Carl,Agree,6,,Agree,7,
Shimer,Robert,Disagree,5,Stronger lockdowns in some European countries have not prevented the need for second lockdowns.,Agree,7,
Stock,James,Agree,9,"But only if followed up by masks, testing & quarantine, etc upon reopening; more severe shutdowns alone wouldn't keep the virus suppressed.",Strongly Agree,8,The predicate for safe K-12 reopening is suppression of the virus and a strategy to keep it so; that plus freeing parents' time is key.
Thaler,Richard,Uncertain,1,"Yeah, probably but so many variables at play that it is hard to be sure about anything. Laws are not enforced. ",Agree,1,Will certainly help families with small children. Female labor force participation is way down. Same as it ever was. 
Udry,Christopher,Agree,6,I would be very confident if the longer & more uniform closings were accompanied by more testing and better tracing.,Strongly Agree,10,
